## Problem Statement
There are more than 4,000 NGO's in Delhi and yet people face difficulties getting in touch with them. There is a serious lack of awareness amongst people locating and volunteering in government approved NGO's. There is a need of a platform that lets volunteers contact these NGO's and vice versa.

## What it does?
SaveOurStrays is a platform that works as a volunteer aggregation platform for animal NGOs / Animal Shelters. Our main aim is to brigde the gap between volunteers and NGO's. This not only lets NGO's post requirements for volunteers but is also helpful for volunteers to look out for NGO's nearby requiring their help.

## Future Scopes
1. This portal can be used to aggregate volunteers for any kind of organisation in the future.
2.
